## About
CodeMonkey as a whole is a **full-stack web application** that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) into any code editor, providing AI-powered assistance similar to GitHub Copilot. 
The app offers real-time code suggestions, auto-completions, and intelligent code snippets, enhancing productivity and reducing development time.

## Contribution
To facilitate testing and interaction with the LLM, I created a **front-end interface** using **React**, **NodeJS**, and **TypeScript** which is containerized with **Docker**. 
This front end is fully responsive and ensures a streamlined user experience, allowing users to easily interact with the LLM.
